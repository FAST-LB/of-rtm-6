* About of6-rtm
  This software is designed for simulations of mold filling and curing in resin transfer molding. It is based on [[https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-6.git][OpenFOAM-6]], a free, open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package released by the OpenFOAM Foundation. Relevant extensions presented in of-rtm6 consist in heterogeneous and porosity dependent permeability, resin cure and cure dependent transport modelling.
