** About the project
  This software is designed for simulations of mold filling and curing in resin transfer molding, a manufacturing process for continuous-fiber reinforced composites. It is based on [[https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-6.git][OpenFOAM-6]], a free, open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package released by the OpenFOAM Foundation. Relevant extensions presented in of-rtm6 consist in heterogeneous and porosity dependent permeability, resin cure and cure dependent transport modelling.

This software originates from KIT's Institute of Vehicle Systems Technology (FAST), Division Lightweight Engineering (Prof. KÃ¤rger and Prof. Henning).
