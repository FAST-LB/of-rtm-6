  This is an extension to OpenFOAM-6 in order to predict the
  infiltration behavior in Liquid Composite Molding
  processes. The porous solver is extended to account for
  fiber orientation and volume fraction dependent
  permeability model and viscosity and kinetic models are
  added to accurately track the curing of the resin as well
  as changes in the viscosity and glass transition
  temperature during the process.

  To capture the infiltration flow of a resin in a porous
  fiber structure, it is necessary to model a fiber
  orientation and fiber volume fraction dependent
  permeability. Moreover curing of the resin is included.
